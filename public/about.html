<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Asad Mehmood, a Web Developer from Pakistan. I'm currently in medical field, aiming to become a doctor soon.</p>

<p>I'm 23 right now, and trying my best to master this field along with medical. My goal is to integrate Technology,
  and more specifically, Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the medical sector, which will definitely be a great achievement.</p>

<p>Nothing is Impossible. I believe AI can cause havoc in medical field.
  If you believe the same, let's be together for something big!
